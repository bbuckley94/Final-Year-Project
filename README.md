#Final-Year-Project

This repository contains all files that were developed for my final year assignment. This includes: all tests and old versions of code, 
prototype algorithms, final versions, results, code for graph creation and final report.

ABSTRACT:
"The intention of this project is to assess the different methods used to enable robots to
traverse different environments at the same time as providing maximal area coverage. This
includes: investigating current techniques of area coverage, implementing them using
agent-based modelling techniques, evaluating the results after a period of experimentation and
presenting the findings in a logical manner. More specifically, this will include producing an
appropriate simulation system using the development environment NetLogo to test a number
of different methods used in the research of multi-robot area coverage."
